The Pattern on the envelopes will never fade away. The vintage crispiness and feeling of completely handmade can never be compared with the factory-made envelope. When We add the word ""handmade"" it's not just a word. It's the feeling of old artisan collecting every material, and making the products with their family y their bare hands. The emotion can never be seen in a factory. The patterns may sometimes be a little different from what is shown in the picture as the artisans make it by hand but one thing you don't need to worry about is the quality of the papers being compromised. We are a very old and trusted manufacturer and seller of handmade papers with a reliable team of artisans which have proved themselves from time to time. You can do Calligraphy, letterpress,watercolor, or any other DIY project. For enhancing the beauty and emotions behind envelopes, We provide the buyers with 3x5"" completely handmade deckle edge sheets for every envelope, on which you can hand-write to be unique in a group of people with the vintage touch to your note. Or you can tear them to make them short, fold them, smash them to give an old vintage classic paper as per your preference. The uniqueness of being with the vintage and completely handmade colorfully or beautifully printed envelope with a note inside or stuck to it made out of Ivory colored handmade deckled edge sheet with your own handwritten words for your friends, families or anyone which can not be compared with a machine-made envelope with machine printed words.
